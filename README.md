# graduation

A site made for counting down the days and classes left until graduation. Accessible on [graduation.alexclimie.com](https://graduation.alexclimie.com). Just put in your name, and see which classes you have left, and who you have them with.

Frontend hosted with Vercel, backend hosted with Shuttle on a digital ocean droplet.

### Data Collection

All data collected is public, fetched from Lionel's timetable API. For not-getting-in-trouble reasons, I won't go into too much detail, but if you're interested it's not too difficult to get the data yourself.

### Documentation

The API is public and requires no authentication for most endpoints. Feel free to use it for your own projects. Documentation can be found [here](api/DOCUMENTATION.md).
